  	Adaptive bitrate streaming is a method for improving streaming over HTTP networks.

  	The term “bitrate” refers to how quickly data travels across a network and is often used to describe an Internet connection’s speed. A high-speed connection is a high-bitrate connection. 
    Streaming — or the process that makes watching videos online possible — consists of transmitting video files hosted in a remote server to a client. In streaming, videos are segmented into 
    smaller clips so viewers do not need to wait for an entire video to load before they can begin watching it.

  	Adaptive bitrate streaming offers many benefits that can improve video quality.
  •	Widening access: Without adaptive bitrate streaming, viewers with slower connections or     certain devices would never be able to see some videos.
  •	Improving the user experience: Adaptive bitrate streaming decreases buffering, so users experience fewer frustrating loading delays.
  •	Enabling mobile viewing with fewer interruptions : For example, connection strength on a home WiFi network may be stronger than a connection on a train or in a shopping mall. By  continuously 
    adjusting to changing conditions, adaptive bitrate streaming can minimize disruptions for mobile viewers.
